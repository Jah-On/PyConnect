# PyConnect
Python based remote desktop application

The appImages were created on the most recent full update of Manjaro and on Python 3.9.1. From now on, I will make them with previous LTS releases on Ubuntu and the oldest version of Python that the libraries will allow to have the appImage work for as many people as possible. 

Windows: Will be compiled on the oldest possible Python version that the libraries allow for.
MacOS: It's a mess... Thanks Apple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First release is out!
Sadly, it is Linux only at the moment, but MacOS and Windows will be added ASAP!
There needs to be some optimization for low end hardware, but should run decently on stable internet with 10MB of L3 cache and DRR4 RAM. 
Please provide feedback with your hardware and experience in the discusions tab!
