This program is no where near complete!

Issues:

  -Keyboard input is repetitive per click. Single Clicke Button b --> bbb, instead of b.
																																																																
  -No encrpyption, HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE OUTSIDE OF LAN.
																																																															
  -Remote screen can't be sent to device managing the other device. 
																																																																
  -Script speed is system and network dependent, may or may not work on your specific system.
																																																																
  -Mouse wheel and mouse wheel button has not been integrated yet.
