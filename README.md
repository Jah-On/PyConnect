# PyConnect
Python based remote desktop application

First release is out!
Sadly, it is Linux only at the moment, but MacOS and Windows will be added ASAP!
There needs to be some optimization for low end hardware, but should run decently on stable internet with 10MB of L3 cache and DRR4 RAM. 
Please provide feedback with your hardware and experience in the discusions tab!
