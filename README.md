# PyConnect
Python based remote desktop application

The appImages were created on the most recent full update of Manjaro and on Python 3.9.1 (Which have been taken down). From now on, I will make them with previous LTS releases on Ubuntu and the oldest version of Python that the libraries will allow to have the appImage work for as many people as possible. 

Windows: Will be compiled on the oldest possible Python version that the libraries allow for. Networking stack needs to be redone. 
MacOS: Most likely to be compliled on Big Sur and the oldest possible Python version that the libraries allow for. Multiproccessing is messed up and I am not sure if I can get around it : (.
